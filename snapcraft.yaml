summary: tooling to work with snap interfaces
description: |
  ifacetool provides tooling to work with snap interfaces, in
  particular their policies as realized via snap-declarations

  One central feature of ifacetool is simulating what snapd will
  do in terms of auto-connections for a group of snaps given snap
  metadata and snap-declaration content.
